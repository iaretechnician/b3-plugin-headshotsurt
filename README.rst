headshotsurt plugin for Big Brother Bot
=======================================

http://www.bigbrotherbot.net

Inspired from the spree plugin by Walker.


Description
-----------

When a player makes a headshot (ie: a kill with last bullet in head or helmet), display in console how many headshots the killer made so far.



Requirements
------------

This plugin will only work with B3 parsers iourt41 and iourt42. Other games won't work.



Installation
------------

- copy headshotsurt.py into b3/extplugins
- copy plugin_headshotsurt.ini in same directory as your b3.xml
- update your main b3 config file with::

    <plugin name="headshotsurt" config="@conf/plugin_headshotsurt.ini"/>

**Note:** for Urban Terror 4.2, you have to use the iourt42 B3 parser for this plugin to detect headshots correctly



Commands
--------

!headshots (or !hs)
  Tells you how many headshots kills you made so far

!headshots (or !hs) <player>
  Tells you how many headshots kills a given player made so far
